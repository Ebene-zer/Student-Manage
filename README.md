This is project is to apply some basic programming concepts and OOP and it purely cli program.
NB: 
1. I'm implememting it in two paradigms (procedural and Object Oriented Programming), each in a seperate file.
2. Database not supported in this program (used python data structures like list, dictionary for data storage). Hence data is lost once the program is closed.
